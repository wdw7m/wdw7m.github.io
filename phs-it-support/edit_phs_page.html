<h1><a name="_Toc317519678" id="_Toc317519678">General Philosophy</a></h1>
<p>            As required  by Health System/School of Medicine policy, the Department of Public Health  Sciences maintains a departmental web site within the Content Management System  (CMS) administered jointly by the School of Medicine Webmaster (Ray Nedzel) and  the Web Development Center (Derrick Stone, Director). Within this site, the  department provides, among other things, a page for each faculty and staff  member to present information about their professional and academic activities.  These personnel pages include basic contact information and division  affiliation, as well as additional information described below (see the  &ldquo;Editing your page&rdquo; section).</p>
<p>	             The intent  of DPHS is to maintain a consistent layout across these pages, so we ask that  you confine your information to requested subjects or areas in the order  defined. You have great latitude within those areas to present a wide variety  of information.  How much or how little  information your provide is up to you; just remember that this is the public  face of DPHS and often the first presentation of your professional &ldquo;face&rdquo; to  our web visitors.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc317519682" id="_Toc317519682">Changing your page editor</a></h1>
<p>The CMS offers three different editors for  your use in making changes to your web page. The editors are embedded into the  CMS and appear when you click the Edit tab at the top of your page. It is  recommended that you work with the default editor but, if you find it&rsquo;s  features too limited or confusing for your purposes, you may elect to try a  different editor.</p>
<ul>
  <li>After logging into the content management  system, click on your name in the lower right corner of the page.</li>
  <li>Click the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; tab at the top of the page.</li>
  <li>About 2/3 of the way down the page is a place to  choose &ldquo;Content Editor&rdquo;.  There are  currently three choices:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic HTML textarea editor (simplest editor)</li>
    <li>Kupu (medium featured editor and the default  editor – good for beginning users)</li>
    <li>TinyMCE (offers most features/tools – good for  advanced users)</li>
  </ul>
